## Why Slack?

first of all, Slack it cool.

Slack brings all your team's communication together, giving everyone a shared workspace where conversations are organized and accessible.

Across your team, there's a range of things people need to communicate about. Channels in Slack give everyone a way to organize all those conversations, while making sure the right people are involved at the right time.

Make a channel for a project, a topic, a team, or anything—everyone has a place to work and a transparent view of all that's going on.

You don’t have to go to every meeting to stay informed. Slack builds a searchable archive of your team’s conversations, decisions, and work — made more useful with machine learning — putting knowledge in everyone’s hands.

Slack integrates with nearly every enterprise and productivity product available, and you can also build your own with our open API. Adding apps to Slack keeps your team coordinated and working faster,all within the context to your converstations.

Slack’s growing ecosystem of 3rd party apps helps you integrate routine workflows into your team’s channels - from task management to expense reporting or running a team survey. Connecting these tools with Slack reduces context switching, letting people take action as the conversation moves forward.

especily your team use GitHub for development.It's great tool. just like this:
